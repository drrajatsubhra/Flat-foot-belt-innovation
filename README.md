## Background
Pediatric **flat foot (pes planus)** can present with reduced plantar arch, valgus heel, and activity-related leg pain. Many cases are flexible and amenable to conservative management with orthoses, exercises, and posture training. This project shares a **non-surgical “Foot Belt”** protocol developed and applied by Dr. Rajatsubhra Mukhopadhyay to relieve symptoms and aid arch support and proprioception.

> See image example of **“Flat foot with minimum plantar arch”** (link below) and the Wikiversity article summarizing the technique.

---

## Innovation: The Foot Belt
A **custom belt-like strap system** that:
- Supports the **medial longitudinal arch**
- Provides **dynamic proprioceptive feedback**
- Is **low-cost**, **adjustable**, and **home-usable** under clinical guidance
- Integrates with **exercise and gait retraining**

This repo includes **protocols** (in `/docs`) and **templates** (in `/data`) to standardize fitting and follow-up.

---

## Mechanism & Rationale
- **Mechanical support:** External strap tension assists navicular lift and calcaneal alignment.
- **Neuromuscular cueing:** Continuous gentle feedback encourages **intrinsic foot muscle** activation and improved gait mechanics.
- **Gradual adaptation:** Scheduled, progressive wear to minimize discomfort.

---

## Indications / Contraindications
**Indications**
- Symptomatic **flexible** flat foot in children with activity-related leg pain or fatigue
- Parental/patient willingness for home-based conservative care and follow-up

**Contraindications / Use with caution**
- **Rigid** flat foot, suspected tarsal coalition
- Acute inflammation, skin breakdown, neuropathy, vascular compromise
- Any scenario your clinical judgment deems unsuitable

---

## Sizing, Fabrication & Fitting
Detailed steps: see [`/docs/sizing-and-fabrication.md`](docs/sizing-and-fabrication.md).  
Images and diagrams: place in [`/media`](media/), then embed here.

**Quick outline**
1. Measure foot length, midfoot girth, heel-to-navicular distance.
2. Cut strap(s) to size; add soft interface/padding.
3. Anchor around midfoot with directed tension supporting medial arch; verify comfort and pulse/capillary refill.
4. Teach caregiver fitting & daily skin checks.

---

## Wearing Schedule
See [`/docs/wearing-schedule.md`](docs/wearing-schedule.md).

Example progression (adjust clinically):
- Week 1: 30–60 min twice daily during walking tasks
- Week 2–3: 1–2 h twice daily
- Week 4+: consolidate to functional periods; reassess arch and symptoms

Always pause for pain, redness, numbness, or skin issues; review fit and tension.

---

## Follow-up & Outcomes
Track at baseline, 2–4 weeks, 8–12 weeks:
- **Symptoms:** pain during/after activity (0–10), fatigue, endurance
- **Observation:** foot posture, arch height (photos/marks), heel alignment
- **Function:** walking distance, activity tolerance
- **Adverse events:** skin issues, discomfort

Use the template [`/data/case-log-template.csv`](data/case-log-template.csv) and clinic note format [`/docs/followup-template.md`](docs/followup-template.md).
